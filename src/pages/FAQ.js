        <summary>What is an off-plan property in Dubai?</summary>
        <p className="para">
          An off-plan property is an unconstructed property purchased directly
          from a developer. It’s a property that is yet to be built or in some
          cases is in the early stages of being built.
        </p>
        <p className="par">
          In order to purchase this type of property buyers rely on brochures
          and other marketing material to learn about the project and the exact
          property they are buying. Purchase is usually made with a 10-20% down
          payment and the signing of the SPA (Sales Purchase Agreement).
          Depending on which developer the rest of the payments made can and do
          vary but are usually linked to construction.{" "}

        <summary>What are the advantages of buying off-plan property in Dubai?</summary>
        <ul className="list">
          <li>
            <strong>Save Money – </strong>Buying an Off plan property allows
            investors to get a purchase price at the earliest and lowest
            possible price. It also allows buyers to choose the very best
            apartments in a particular development. This plays a big part in
            increasing the chances of gaining the maximum return on their
            investment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sell Before Completion – </strong>Quite often investors can
            sell off their off-plan property prior to a project’s completion.
            Assuming the market has performed well and the project proved
            popular owners can often sell at a considerable profit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lower up Front Costs – </strong>Payment plans for off plan
            property can and do vary from developer to developer. With some
            developers only requiring a 5% down payment and the rest linked to
            constructions the outlay required is relatively low.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You Buy Brand New – </strong>As much as most of us hate to
            admit it, we all love something new. Whether it’s a new car or a
            brand-new property there is something rather special and satisfying
            about having something that has never been used before. This is
            exactly what you get with an off plan property that is not only new
            but if done right will feature the latest design, technology and
            lifestyle features, and amenities.
